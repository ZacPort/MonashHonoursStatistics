# Random Intercepts and Slopes

## Theory / Conceptual

Thus far we have learned about estimating LMMs where only the
intercept is a random effect, although we've added fixed effect
between and within predictors, looked at diagnostics, interpretations,
etc.

In addition to allowing intercepts to differ by person, we can also
allow regression slopes to differ by person. In LMMs, we always
include a random intercept. That means if we also include a random
slope, we will have two random effects. With two (or more) random
effects, because they are assumed to be a random variable with a
normal distribution, we can also look at how the random effects
correlate with each other. That is, just as how you could look at how
two random variables, say age and stress, correlate with each other,
you can look at how any two random effects correlate with each other
(e.g., how a random intercept and random slope correlate).

When working with random slopes, we also need to slightly modify our
understanding of the assumptions and notation for LMMs.

Let $\mathbf{G}$ be a square, $q$ x $q$ covariance matrix, where $q$
is the number of random effects in the model. In our simplest of
examples, there is only one random effect, the random intercept, so $q
= 1$ and the random effect covariance matrix is:

$$
\mathbf{G} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma^{2}_{int} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

If we had a random intercept only, then we assume:

$$ u_{0j} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \mathbf{G}) $$

This is the same assumption we covered in the introduction to LMMs,
however the subtle change in notation sets us up for more complexity.
By using $\mathbf{G}$ we are replacing a single standard
deviation/variance with a covariance matrix. The benefit of the matrix
is that a covariance matrix can be small, like a 1 x 1 matrix or
bigger like a 2 x 2 or $q$ x $q$ matrix for any number of random
effects.

So what is the implication of this change? We do not *just* assume
that each random effect follows a normal distribution. In fact, for
LMMs, the assumption is that the random effects follow a
**multivariate** normal distribution^[for more info, see here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution]. 
The multivariate normal distribution (MVN) is a distribution for
multiple variables. If $q$ variables follow a MVN, then each $q_i$
variable will itself follow a univariate normal distribution.
However, just because each $q_i$ variable individually follows a
univariate normal distribution does not mean that the $q$ variables
together follow a MVN.  In other words, MVN implies univariate normal,
but univariate normal does not imply MVN.

Like the univariate normal distribution, the MVN has two basic
parameters, the mean and variance. However, unlike a univariate normal
distribution, the MVN the means will be a vector of means, one for
each variable, and the variances, will be a $q$ x $q$ covariance
matrix. 

Back to LMMs, what this means is that if we have a random intercept
and a random slope, $q = 2$ and we'd have:

$$
\mathbf{G} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma^{2}_{int} & \sigma_{int,slope} \\
\sigma_{int,slope} & \sigma^{2}_{slope} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The variances are on the diagonal and the covariance (the
unstandardized correlation between the intercept and the slope) is on
the off diagonal.

The usual practice in LMMs is to freely estimate both the variances
and covariances (correlations) for any random effects. We can,
however, also assume that the random effects are uncorrelated, that
is, assume that the random effects follow a multivariate normal
distribution like this:

$$
\mathbf{G} =
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma^{2}_{int} & 0 \\
0 & \sigma^{2}_{slope} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Although random slopes are different in some respects from a random
intercept, in most ways they are comparable. In both cases we assume a
normal distribution, with a mean (the "fixed effect" part, the average
slope across people) and a standard deviation (how much variability
there is in the slope across people). We estimate the mean and
standard deviation, but we *can* get BLUPs for the individual slopes
as well, which are predictions about what the slope is for any
specific individual. While a random intercept only impacts the level
of lines, a random slope will impact both the level and the slope of
the lines, shown graphically in the following figure.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 10, fig.cap = "Figure showing a random intercept or random intercept and slope"}

ggplot(expand.grid(x = c(0, 10), y = c(0, 10)), aes(x, y)) +

ncol = 1, nrow = 2)

```

To evaluate the distributional assumptions of LMMs with multiple
random effects, the ideal test is to evaluate whether the random
effects come from a MVN. Visualizing MVN distributions is not easy,
especially with more than 2 dimensions, so instead we use another
approach.

The Mahalanobis distance measures the distance between a point and a
space defined by a vector of means and a covariance matrix. The
"point" can be unidimensional or multidimensional and if multidimensional
is not limited to only two dimensions. That is, the Mahalanobis
distance can compute the distance between a multidimensional point and
a multidimensional distribution. This is very convenient as it scales
arbitrarily to however complex (many random effects) or simple (one
random effect) we may have. If for each row of data, we calculate its
Mahalanobis distance, those squared distances will follow a $\chi^{2}$
(chi-squared) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number
of dimensions ($p$), that is a $\chi^2$ distribution with $df =
p$ if the raw data were MVN. This allows us to compare our observed
Mahalanobis distances to a chi-squared distribution and if they are a
close match, it indicates the data on which the Mahalanobis distances
were calculated were MVN. Thus, we can use Mahalanobis distances to
evaluate whether a set of variables have a MVN distribution.
They also can help identify multivariate outliers. We will see
examples of this when we look at diagnostics for LMMs with multiple
random effects.

## Random Slopes in `R`

Random slopes can only be estimated for predictors that vary within
units. Using the merged daily data collection exercise dataset, we can
look at mood predicting stress. First, we will take a look at a model
with a random intercept and `dEnergy` as a fixed effect only.

```{r}

## get rid of the haven_labeled class type for stress
dm[, dStress := as.numeric(dStress)]

m0 <- lmer(dStress ~ dEnergy + (1 | ID),
           data = dm)

summary(m0)

plot(modelDiagnostics(m0), ncol = 2, nrow = 2, ask = FALSE)

```

From the results, we can see that on average, higher energy is
associated with lower stress. Energy has not been separated into a
between or within component, so we cannot say whether its driven by
people who have higher energy on average having lower stress or days
with higher than usual energy having lower than usual stress, or both.
We can see that the residuals (top left graph panel) and random
intercept by ID (bottom left graph panel) are about normally
distributed with only modest if any outliers and we can see that the
homogeneity of variance assumption is approximately met at least in
the residuals vs fitted/predicted values (top right).

Next, we add dEnergy as a random slope by adding it inside the
parentheses before ID, `(dEnergy | ID)`.

```{r}

m1 <- lmer(dStress ~ dEnergy + (dEnergy | ID),
           data = dm)

summary(m1)

```

The output is fairly familiar to the fixed effect slope and random
intercept only model but there is another random effect under the
groups ID for `dEnergy`. We get the variance and standard deviation of
`dEnergy` as well as the correlation between the random intercept and the
random slope. The correlation is 
`r as.data.table(VarCorr(m1))[3, sdcor]` indicating that people who
have a higher level of stress when energy is 0 (the intercept) also tend
to have a more negative slope of stress on energy. Note that although
the fixed effect slope estimate for energy is about the same between the
two models, the standard error is larger so the p-value is higher
(further away from 0) for the model with a fixed and random slope of
`dEnergy` than the model with only a fixed slope of `dEnergy`. This is a
fairly common pattern.

Now we can look at model diagnostic plots. We use 2 columns and 3 rows
as there are more plots now, but otherwise we use the usual 
`modelDiagnostics()` function.


```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 10}

plot(modelDiagnostics(m1), ncol = 2, nrow = 3, ask = FALSE)

```

In the figure, we see our familiar density and QQ deviates plot for
the residuals (top left). Univariate density plots (black lines) and
univariate normal distributions (blue dashed lines) for the random
intercept alone (`ID : (Intercept)`) and the random slope of energy
alone (`ID : dEnergy`). The naming convention is to include the
coefficient name, intercept or energy for the energy slope, prefixed by
what the variable name is for the random effect, here ID. Both of the
univariate random effect distribution plots can be interpreted as
usual and are shown on the middle row, left and right panels. What is
technically graphed are the BLUPs and at the bottom we can get a five
number summary to help see the minimum, 25th percentile, 50th
percentile (median), 75th percentile, and maximum, which can give us
some sense of the spread of the random intercept and slope. For
example, for the random slope of energy, the maximum BLUP is 0.07,
indicating that the highest predicted individual slope for anyone is
0.07. This tells us that not many people are expected to have *higher* stress if
they have higher energy. We can also see that 50% of people have BLUPs
between -0.20 and -0.07, giving us a sense of the spread of the random
slopes.

The new graph is on the bottom row, left side and it evaluates whether
the random effects by ID follow a MVN or not by using the Mahalanobis
distances. The observed density is the black line. The theoretical
density again is in dashed blue line. Here the theoretical density
**is not** a normal density, but a chi-squared density with $df = p =
2$. In this case, we can see that its not a terrible fit between the
observed and theoretical chi-squared density, suggesting the MVN
assumption is reasonably well met. We also can see, however, that
there are some relatively extreme distances, with the maximum at 13.72
being quite a bit higher than the next nearest. Although its not
flagged as an extreme value, partly because there are only about 88
people. 

In practice, I may not actually make any changes here. For the sake of
illustration, however, and to show how to do it, we will use a more
stringent criteria for extreme values. Rather than defining an extreme
value as the top and bottom 0.5% of the theoretical distribution,
let's use the top and bottom 1% of the theoretical distribution.
Because I know this will yield some extreme values to remove, I am
saving the results of `modelDiagnostics()` in an object, `m1.diag`
which I can plot but I can also use to identify which rows / IDs in
the dataset are extreme and should / could be dropped.
The new figure shows a few extreme values in the random effect
BLUPs. Maybe a low value on the intercept, definitely a couple too low
slopes, and maybe one MVN extreme value, the 13.72 Mahalanobis
distance. 

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 10}

m1.diag <- modelDiagnostics(m1, ev.perc = .01)
plot(m1.diag, ncol = 2, nrow = 3, ask=FALSE)

``` 

To consider removing these cases, we need to identify them.
The `m1.diag` object in `R` has several subparts, but we are
particularly interested here in the `extremeValues` subpart, which is
itself a little data table, shown in the following.

```{r}

m1.diag$extremeValues

``` 

In this extreme values data table, we can see a few columns. The most
important columns are:

- `ID` this is the ID variable from the dataset and will be helpful
  later.
- `Index` this is the row number in the dataset used in the LMM and
  can be used to identify specific rows of data that are extreme.
- `EffectType` this indicates what type of effect the extreme value
  was identified on.
  
The first column, `dstress` just shows the outcome variable score for
reference, which may help but is not necessarily that useful always.
The name of the first column will depend on the name of the outcome
variable 

In this dataset, we can see that there are three extreme values
identified on the residuals. For all the random effects, because the
BLUPs are calculated per person, not per observation if a person is
classified as an extreme value, then all observations belonging to
that specific ID will be shown. That is because at the random effect
level, a person as a whole unit is either extreme or not and if
extreme the only "choice" would be to exclude / modify that entire person.

Because there are multiple types of extreme values, we could have some
choice in how to address them. We could remove any extreme values, or
remove one at a time and re-run the model to see if anything else
remained extreme or not. For example, we can see that ID 23 is an
extreme value on the random effect of dEnergy as well as the random
intercept. Dropping ID 23 might change the rest enough that say some
of the other residuals are no longer extreme. Conversely, we could
drop some of the extreme residuals, specific 'weird' days and see if
that happens to address any of the random effects. In this case, it is
not too likely as the extreme residuals come from different
participants (IDs 29, 64, 110) than do the extreme values on the random
effects.

A relatively intense approach would be to drop all of these extreme
values and re-estimate the LMM in the dataset with these rows / IDs
excluded.  Here are different ways that we could do that.

The first approach uses the `Index` column from the extreme values
data table and then we pass that to our dataset, `dm` and use the
minus sign to indicate we want to drop those rows of data.
Note that because the same rows are extreme on a few different
measures, we use the `unique()` function so that we only drop each row
once. This never hurts to use, as if all rows are already unique its
fine, but it helps if there are duplicate extreme values (e.g., Index
29 is extreme on the random intercept and random effect of dEnergy).

```{r}

dm.noev1 <- dm[-unique(m1.diag$extremeValues$Index)]

``` 

Another approach, supposing we only wanted to drop selected IDs. For
example, we could decide that we want to only get rid of ID 23. 
Here we use the `%nin%` operator which takes a variable
on the left and returns `TRUE` if it is not in (nin) the value/vector
of values on the right hand side. This operator comes from the
`extraoperators` package so we need to have that loaded.

```{r}

dm.noev2 <- dm[ID %nin% 23]

#Here I'm going to create an alternate version of this with a different ID (29) to show you something later, forget it for now:
dm.noev2a <- dm[ID %nin% 29]

``` 

Supposing we wanted to remove IDs 23, 109 and 143, we could use the
same approach but instead of listing one ID, we'd list all three as a
vector, like this:

```{r}

dm.noev3 <- dm[ID %nin% c(23, 109, 143)]

``` 

If we wanted to only exclude one type of effect, say only the MVN
extreme values, we could use the row indices but pre-select specific
effect types. We can do this because the extreme values dataset is a
regular data table, so we can operate on it the same as we would on
any dataset. Let's just confirm that we can subset the extreme values
dataset to only give us the MVN extreme values.


```{r}

m1.diag$extremeValues[EffectType == "Multivariate Random Effect ID"]

```

Now that that works, we can use the same approach we did to exclude
all extreme values, but using this subsetted dataset. We replace:
`m1.diag$extremeValues` with 
`m1.diag$extremeValues[EffectType == "Multivariate Random Effect ID"]`
and then we use just the `Index` column as before by writing:
`$Index`.


```{r}

dm.noev4 <- dm[-unique(m1.diag$extremeValues[EffectType == "Multivariate Random Effect ID"]$Index)]

``` 

If you wanted even more customized options, you could achieve those by
making the subsetting of the extreme values dataset fancier (e.g.,
picking multiple but not all effect types, etc.)^[This is one of the
benefits of `R` and an approach where everything is an object. We can
use the output from one function, `modelDiagnostics()`, and because it
returns an object, a dataset of extreme values, we can operate on it
as we want and then use those results to subset our main dataset for
analysis.].

At this point, we can re-run our analysis using the revised dataset.
For the sake of example, I will just use our dataset that
excluded only one person, `dm.noev2`.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 10}

m1noev <- lmer(dStress ~ dEnergy + (dEnergy | ID),
           data = dm.noev2)

summary(m1noev)

m1noev.diag <- modelDiagnostics(m1noev, ev.perc = .01)
plot(m1noev.diag, ncol = 2, nrow = 3, ask=FALSE)

```

The results look fairly similar, although the correlation between the
random intercept and slope has dropped from 
`r as.data.table(VarCorr(m1))[3, sdcor]`
to 
`r as.data.table(VarCorr(m1noev))[3, sdcor]`
and the average slope of energy on stress, the fixed effect part, is
somewhat weaker going from 
`r fixef(m1)[["dEnergy"]]` to 
`r fixef(m1noev)[["dEnergy"]]`.

The diagnostics also look improved.

A shorter trick to re-running the same model on a new dataset is to
use the `update()` function. The `update()` function takes an existing
model, and you can update that model in different ways. Here, we will
update the model by just using a new dataset, here the dataset where
we only excluded a different ID, `dm.noev2a`. This is just to
illustrate how easy it is even without knowing the formula for a model
to just update an old model on a different dataset. This is very
helpful for running models with and without extreme values or with and
without some participants who perhaps did not follow the study
protocol correctly, etc. The benefit of using `update()` is that even
if you have lots of predictors in your model, you don't have to type
them all again and you are guaranteed to have the same model as
before, just with a new dataset, no chance for typos and forgetting a
predictor or covariate.

```{r}

m1noev2 <- update(m1, data = dm.noev2a)
summary(m1noev2)
# Note - you could do this theoretically with any of the dm.noev models we created.
# It just so happens that when we remove too much in our dataset, the models don't coverge!
```

In the previous topic, we added both between and within person
variants of a predictor into a LMM as fixed effects. Now let's take a
look at doing that with both fixed and random slopes.
First, we need to create a between and within person version of our
predictor, `dEnergy`. Note that this only works because energy was measured
each day (which is why it has the d at the front of the variable name).
It would not work if `dEnergy` was measured only once, it would
already be a between person variable. Note also that mean deviations
only makes sense for continuous predictors. If `dEnergy` was binary, it
would not make sense to look at the average and the deviations from
the average, probably.


```{r}

dm[, c("Benergy", "Wenergy") := meanDeviations(dEnergy), by = ID]

```

Now we can fit a LMM with `Benergy` and `Wenergy` as fixed effects and a
random intercept and random slope for `Wenergy`. Note that the random
intercept is included automatically, without us having to ask for it
explicitly. We also look at the model diagnostics and confidence
intervals.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 10}

iccMixed("dStress",id="ID",data=dm) ## Let's get the ICC

m2 <- lmer(dStress ~ Benergy + Wenergy +
             (Wenergy | ID),
           data = dm)

summary(m2)

m2.diag <- modelDiagnostics(m2)
plot(m2.diag, ncol = 2, nrow = 3, ask=FALSE)

m2.ci <- confint(m2, oldNames = FALSE)
m2.ci

```

In the output, we now see the random slope is for `Wenergy` and under
fixed effects we have both `Benergy` and `Wenergy`. In this instance both
the sign and the magnitude of the fixed effects for the slope of
`Benergy` and `Wenergy` on stress are about the same. However, this does
not have to be true. In fact, its even possible for the between person
effect to have one sign and the within person effect to have the
opposite sign for the slope^[A conceptual example of why the between
and within might differ. Imagine that you look at the relationship
between exercise and well being. You might find that people that
exercise more on average have better average wellbeing. However, if
people exercise more than usual for them, they might over exercise and
that be associated with worse wellbeing. Because overexercising is
relative to an individuals' own fitness level, it only shows up at the
within person only level. Although this is relatively rare, it often
happens that the magnitude of effects varies across the between person
and within person effects.].

Visually, all the diagnostics look relatively OK, although there are a
few extreme values (now using the default top and bottom 0.5% of the
theoretical distribution definition) on the residuals and on the
random intercept. In practice, it would be worthwhile to consider
whether these extreme values should be addressed somehow or if you are
comfortable proceeding as is.

The profile likelihood confidence intervals take a few seconds to
complete and generate a few warnings related to the fact that the
lower bound for the intercept-slope correlation is -1, the lowest
possible correlation.

### Sample Write Up

A linear mixed model was fit to 
`r nobs(m2)` stress scores from 
`r as.integer(ngrps(m2))` people. The intraclass correlation
coefficient of stress, the outcome, was 
`r iccMixed("dStress", id = "ID", data = dm)$ICC[1]` and of energy, the
predictor was 
`r iccMixed("dEnergy", id = "ID", data = dm)$ICC[1]`,
indicating that about 40% of the total variance in stress and about
28% of the total variance in energy exists between people with the
remaining due to daily fluctuations within people.
The fixed effect intercept revealed that the
estimated average [95% CI] stress was 
`r fixef(m2)[["(Intercept)"]]`
`r sprintf("[%0.2f, %0.2f]", m2.ci[5, 1], m2.ci[5, 2])`, when `Benergy`
and `Wenergy` are zero.
However, there were individual differences, with the standard
deviation for the random intercept being
`r as.data.table(VarCorr(m2))[1, sdcor]`
indicating that there are individual differences. Assuming the random
intercepts follow a normal distribution, 
we expect most people to fall within one standard deviation of the
mean, which in these data would be somewhere between:
`r fixef(m2)[["(Intercept)"]] + c(-1, 1) *  as.data.table(VarCorr(m2))[1, sdcor]`. 
There was also a significant fixed effect of average energy on stress,
such that each one unit higher average energy people had was associated
with `r fixef(m2)[["Benergy"]]` 
95% CI = `r sprintf("[%0.2f, %0.2f]", m2.ci[6, 1], m2.ci[6, 2])`.

There was no significant fixed effect of within person energy on
stress,`r fixef(m2)[["Wenergy"]]` 
95% CI = `r sprintf("[%0.2f, %0.2f]", m2.ci[7, 1], m2.ci[7, 2])`.

(If this would have been significant, you could report that: On 
days where people were one unit higher on energy than their 
own average, people were expected to have 
`r fixef(m2)[["Wenergy"]]` 
95% CI = `r sprintf("[%0.2f, %0.2f]", m2.ci[7, 1], m2.ci[7, 2])`
lower stress that same day, on average. However, there were
individual differences, with the standard deviation for the
random slope being
`r as.data.table(VarCorr(m2))[2, sdcor]`
indicating that there are individual differences in the slope of
within person energy on stress. 
Assuming the random slope follow a normal distribution,
we expect most people to fall within one standard deviation of the
mean, which in these data would indicate that most people are expected
to have a within person slope of stress on energy between:
`r fixef(m2)[["Wenergy"]] + c(-1, 1) *  as.data.table(VarCorr(m2))[2, sdcor]`.)

Finally, there was a negative correlation between the random intercept
and slope, 
`r as.data.table(VarCorr(m2))[3, sdcor]`
indicating that compared to the population averages, people who had a
relatively higher stress when energy was 0 also tended to have a
more negative within person association between energy and stress.

## Solving Convergence/Estimation Issues

We have talked before some about convergence, where algorithms iterate
through cycles and try to find the best parameter estimates. Sometimes
this process fails or runs into problems, which we may broadly call
convergence or estimation issues.

Sometimes these do not make too big of a difference, sort of false
positives, but sometimes these issues may severely impact a models'
results. If you see warnings about convergence or estimation, its best
to address and resolve them before being confident in the model
results.

Let's create a between and within version of the daily variable,
`dMood` and look at a fixed and random slope LMM predicting stress
from mood

```{r}

dm[, c("Bmood", "Wmood") := meanDeviations(dMood), by = ID]

# Please note, for demonstration purposes, I'm using a different outcome variable, "stress"
# rather than dStress (as that model converged fine) - stress is just the average across days
mest <- lmer(stress ~ Bmood + Wmood +
             (Wmood | ID),
             data = dm)

``` 

When we estimate the model, we get a message about a boundary
(singular) fit with the suggestion to see `?isSingular`.
This is a helpful suggestion and provides more details on potential
approaches to resolving it. If we run 
`?isSingular` in the `R` console will get a help page with some more
information, which you **should** do and go read now.

Armed with that knowledge, we can run a `summary()` on our model to
learn a bit more. Its not always clear, but in this case we can see a
correlation of 1 between the random intercept and slope that is
causing the singularity.

```{r}

summary(mest)

```

Our options for resolving this are listed in `?isSingular`. In this
case, a simple path forward is to remove some random effects. We
basically always keep a random intercept in our LMMs, so the only
candidate to remove is the random slope for `Wmood`. 
Sometimes when doing that we no longer get the singularity warning, but
in this case, the model still failed to converge, so we should not trust 
the results.

```{r}

mest2 <- lmer(stress ~ Bmood + Wmood +
             (1 | ID),
             data = dm)

summary(mest2)

``` 

If you have multiple random slopes, it can be tricky to decide which
one to drop.

Now let's look at a convergence issue. For this, we'll use another
dataset, the `aces_daily` data. First we setup the data (from the
`JWileymisc` package) and then fit a model with a random slope of
stress predicting negative affect.

```{r}

data(aces_daily)

mconv <- lmer(NegAff ~ STRESS + (1 + STRESS | UserID),
          data = aces_daily)

``` 

In this case, we get a warning message that the model did not
converge. This is not a singularity issue. This means that the
algorithm that tries to find the best parameter estimates tried and
failed to find estimates its confident are 'best'. For now, we won't
worry too much about what the 'best' actually means. In this case,
sometimes using a different optimizer, basically the algorithm that
goes about trying to find the best estimates, or changing its options
can help. We can control the underlying algorithms using the
`lmerControl()` function. In this unit, we are not going to talk much
about the different options but just show one alternate you could try
if you run into convergence problems.


```{r}

## use the control function to pick a  different algorithm
## and adjust the options to be a bit stricter
## may take longer but also may have a better chance of converging
strictControl <- lmerControl(optCtrl = list(
   algorithm = "NLOPT_LN_NELDERMEAD",
   xtol_abs = 1e-12,
   ftol_abs = 1e-12))

## now fit our model
mconv2 <- lmer(NegAff ~ STRESS + (1 + STRESS | UserID),
               data = aces_daily,
               control = strictControl)

```

In this case, the change in algorithm and options did it and we now
get our model converging without warnings. Sometimes it may still have
warnings and none of what you know how to try will solve those. In
those cases, you'd either want to consult an expert or simplify the
model. Very often, much as with singularity issues, convergence issues
surround the random effects in a model. If you remove some of the
random effects (at the extreme a random intercept only) you are likely
to resolve the convergence issues, although you may give up aspects of
the model you wanted to keep.

Sometimes as well, the convergence issues may not make much
difference. Here we can look at the model results that did not
converge quite and those that did.

```{r}

summary(mconv)

summary(mconv2)

``` 

In this instance, the only apparent difference is in the 4th decimal
point of the standard deviation of the random intercept.
While the first algorithm did not quite achieve estimates it was
confident are the best, it was really very close. Sometimes however,
the estimates could be far off. If you cannot get a model that
converges, though, you have no comparison so its hard to know if the
non convergence was an issue or not. That is why its generally the
best idea to always resolve a non convergence issue if possible and be
very cautious about interpreting a model that did not converge.

# Graphing LMMs

We can graph results from LMMs much as we do for linear regressions or
GLMs. There are a few nuances, however. In LMMs, people sometimes
refer to marginal or conditional effects. In some ways, these
correspond to the idea of fixed or random effects.

Marginal predictions are based only on the averages, basically the fixed
effects portion of the model. Conditional predictions incorporate
**both** the fixed and random effects portion of the model.

Because the conditional predictions incorporate random effects, they
can only be made for the existing data because it is impossible to
know what a new person would look like (e.g., if you recruited one
more participant, would their BLUP be like ID 1, ID 2, or ID XX?).
Therefore, conditional predictions are only made off the data used to
build the model. Marginal predictions could be made for new data,
though to answer a question like, what would the model predict, on
average, the stress score would be if mood was 2 points above average
on a day? That would not tell you how any single individual is
predicted to be, but does indicate what, on average, the prediction
would be from the model. Additionally, because conditional predictions
will vary by ID, we can get different conditional predictions for each
participant in the dataset.
We will look at examples of both of these briefly.

## Marginal

Graphs based off the marginal predictions from the model are probably
the default and most common approach. These graphs show the average
association or predictions from the model and basically graph the
fixed effects part of the model. They are interpreted nearly
identically to linear regression graphs.

To start, we will use our model with between person and within person
energy predicting stress with a random intercept and random slope for
within person energy, called `m2`. We use the `visreg()` function to
graph the results with the x axis being `Benergy` and the y axis the
predicted stress scores.

```{r, error = TRUE}

m2 <- lmer(dStress ~ Benergy + Wenergy + 
             (Wenergy | ID),
           data = dm)

visreg(m2, xvar = "Benergy")

``` 

This however results in an error message about a differing number of
rows. Its not clear from the error message, but since everything else
in the code is right, we can infer this error message has something to
do with the underlying data. We can use the `str()` function to get
the classes in `R` for each of our variables.

```{r}

str(dm[, .(dStress, Benergy, Wenergy, ID)])

```

Here we can see that `Wenergy` has the class haven labeled. As this is
not a common class (common classes in `R` are logical, integer,
factor, numeric, character), its a reasonable guess that is causing
the trouble. `visreg()` may not know how to work with haven labeled
type variables. We don't need the labels so we can convert `Wenergy` to
a numeric variable and try again. Since we are using a model, after
updating `Wenergy` we need to re-run our LMM. The results will not
change but hopefully now `visreg()` will work as expected.

```{r}

dm[, Wenergy := as.numeric(Wenergy)]

m2 <- lmer(dStress ~ Benergy + Wenergy + 
             (Wenergy | ID),
           data = dm)

visreg(m2, xvar = "Benergy",
       partial = FALSE, rug = FALSE,
       gg = TRUE,
       xlab = "Average Energy",
       ylab = "Predicted Stress",
       line = list(col = "black", size = 1)) + 
  theme_pubr()

``` 

The graph shows us how average energy (between person energy) and stress
are associated on average. We made a number of customizations to the
graph, including not showing partial residuals, no rug plot, defining
our own x and y axis labels, and changing the line colour to black
(the default is blue), and use the `pubr` theme.


We can make the same plot for within person energy. We just change the
`xvar` option to be `Wenergy`. We also make a bit fancier x axis
label. Note the use of "\n" that tells `R` that we want a line break
in the x axis label.

```{r}

visreg(m2, xvar = "Wenergy",
       partial = FALSE, rug = FALSE,
       gg = TRUE,
       xlab = "Within Energy\n(deviations from own average)",
       ylab = "Predicted Stress",
       line = list(col = "black", size = 1)) + 
  theme_pubr()

``` 

This figure shows the negative fixed effect coefficient for `Wenergy` graphically.

## Conditional

We can use `visreg()` function to graph conditional predictions as
well. We will make a few modifications compared to the marginal
graph.

1. We specify that we want lines `by = "ID"` to indicate
   we should get a separate line for each ID.
2. We specify particular `breaks`, these are the breaks for the `by`
   variable and in this case indicate which specific IDs should be
   plotted. To see available IDs, we look at `unique(dm$ID)`. I've
   chosen a few IDs to show for example. You could pick others.
3. We specify the `re.form` argument. If we want to incorporate all
   random effects in the predictions, we should specify the same
   formula for random effects as we did in the model. If we want to
   only incorporate some but not all random effects, we can specify a
   modified formula, we'll look at some examples a bit later.

With those changes we get the following figure. Each ID is separated
into a separate plot panel.

```{r, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}

unique(dm$ID)

visreg(m2, xvar = "Wenergy", by = "ID",
       breaks = c(10, 35, 54, 64, 99, 101),
       re.form = ~ (Wenergy | ID),
       partial = FALSE, rug = FALSE,
       gg = TRUE,
       xlab = "Within Energy\n(deviations from own average)",
       ylab = "Predicted Stress") + 
  theme_pubr() +
  ggtitle("Conditional Random Intercept and Slope")

```

Note that these are not raw regression lines per person, they are
conditional predictions from the LMM, so they will include shrinkage
of the random intercept and slopes to the overall sample average
intercept and slope. Nevertheless, we can see that there are quite
large differences in the within person association between energy and
stress for say ID 10 compared to ID 101. They are not the same, and
although in the marginal plots section earlier, we saw that on average
there is a negative association between within person energy and stress,
not everyone exactly has a negative predicted slope (10 looks a little positive).

If we did not want to incorporate all random effects in the
predictions, we could modify the `re.form`. This does not change the
LMM we fit, it merely changes which random effects are incorporated
into the predictions from the regression model and then plotted.
For example, we could only include the intercept, which gives us the
following figure:

```{r, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}

visreg(m2, xvar = "Wenergy", by = "ID",
       breaks = c(10, 35, 54, 64, 99, 101),
       re.form = ~ (1 | ID),
       partial = FALSE, rug = FALSE,
       gg = TRUE,
       xlab = "Within Energy\n(deviations from own average)",
       ylab = "Predicted Stress") + 
  theme_pubr() +
  ggtitle("Conditional Random Intercept")

```

What this figure showed is each individual IDs own predicted
intercept, but it used the average marginal slope for within person
mood and stress for all IDs.

Finally, if we leave out the `re.form` section all together, we get
the marginal intercept and marginal slope, which is just the same as
our marginal graph but repeated for each ID, a fairly useless figure,
but it highlights what happens if you forget to include `re.form` in
your conditional graph.

```{r, fig.fullwidth = TRUE}

visreg(m2, xvar = "Wenergy", by = "ID",
       breaks = c(10, 35, 54, 64, 99, 101),
       partial = FALSE, rug = FALSE,
       gg = TRUE,
       xlab = "Within Energy\n(deviations from own average)",
       ylab = "Predicted Stress") + 
  theme_pubr() +
  ggtitle("Unconditional (marginal) only")


```

If you don't want to look at specific IDs too carefully but instead
want to get some sense of the overall variation or you have small
number of IDs, you can overlay all the lines together by specifying 
`overlay = TRUE`.

```{r}

visreg(m2, xvar = "Wenergy", by = "ID",
       breaks = c(10, 35, 54, 64, 99, 101),
       re.form = ~ (Wenergy | ID),
       partial = FALSE, rug = FALSE,
       gg = TRUE,
       xlab = "Within Energy\n(deviations from own average)",
       ylab = "Predicted Stress",
       overlay = TRUE) + 
  theme_pubr()

```

To see the overall variation in conditional intercepts and slopes, we
could set the breaks equal to all the IDs by using:
`breaks = unique(dm$ID)`.

```{r}

visreg(m2, xvar = "Wenergy", by = "ID",
       breaks = unique(dm$ID),
       re.form = ~ (Wenergy | ID),
       partial = FALSE, rug = FALSE,
       gg = TRUE,
       xlab = "Within Energy\n(deviations from own average)",
       ylab = "Predicted Stress",
       overlay = TRUE) + 
  theme_pubr()

``` 

With so many different people, we probably do not care about or want
the legend, we can turn that off in `ggplot2` by adding no position to
the legend as shown in the following.


```{r}

visreg(m2, xvar = "Wenergy", by = "ID",
       breaks = unique(dm$ID),
       re.form = ~ (Wenergy | ID),
       partial = FALSE, rug = FALSE,
       gg = TRUE,
       xlab = "Within Energy\n(deviations from own average)",
       ylab = "Predicted Stress",
       overlay = TRUE) + 
  theme_pubr() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

``` 

What this figure helps show is how both the random intercept and slope
influence the results and the individual differences in both level of
stress and slope of stress on within person energy in the data. In this
case, for example, it seems that the individual differences in level
of stress may be larger than the individual differences in slope. With
a few exceptions, a lot of the slopes are *relatively* similar, albeit
not exactly the same.

# You Try It

To try it out yourself, see if you can predict energy from between and
within person stress including a random intercept and slope. Check
diagnostics and try to solve any convergence or singularity issues you
may run into (if you cannot solve them, try your best and detail what
you tried). Make a conditional graph of your results.

Here are the basic steps.

1. Create a between and within person stress variable
2. Since we know `visreg()` does not like haven labeled type
   variables, check if any of your stress variables or the `dEnergy`
   variable is haven labeled and if so, convert them to numeric.
3. Fit a LMM using `lmer()` with both `Bstress` and `Wstress` as fixed
   effects and a random intercept and random `Wstress` slope by ID.
4. Check model diagnostics and where appropriate remove extreme
   values.
5. Make a summary of the final model.
6. Use `visreg()` to make a conditional plot.


```{r, eval = FALSE}


## 1. Create a between and within person stress variable

#### here's a start:
## dm[, meanDeviations() ] 

## 2. Since we know `visreg()` does not like haven labeled type
##    variables, check if any of your stress variables or the `energy`
##    variable is haven labeled and if so, convert them to numeric.

#### here's a start:
## str(dm[, .(ID, dEnergy,       ) ])

## 3. Fit a LMM using `lmer()` with both `Bstress` and `Wstress` as fixed
##    effects and a random intercept and random `Wstress` slope by ID.

#### here's a start:
## yourmodel <- lmer(dEnergy ~          )

## 4. Check model diagnostics and where appropriate remove extreme
##    values.

#### here's a start:
## yourdiag <- modelDiagnostics(      )
## plot(  yourdiag  )


## 5. Make a summary of the final model.

#### here's a start
## summary(  yourmodel  )

## 6. Use `visreg()` to make a conditional plot.

#### here's a start, change up as needed
#### don't forget, if you drop some IDs, need to drop them here too
#### by changing the dataset in the unique() call
#visreg(m2, xvar = "Wmood", by = "ID",
#       breaks = unique(dm$ID),
#       re.form = ~ (Wmood | ID),
#       partial = FALSE, rug = FALSE,
#       gg = TRUE,
#       xlab = "Within Mood\n(deviations from own average)",
#       ylab = "Predicted Stress",
#       overlay = TRUE) + 
#  theme_pubr() +
#  theme(legend.position = "none")

```
